# Book Review App

Getting back in the groove with the back-end on RoR in prep for [RoR 5.1](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html)

Basic Objectives:
* Make a functioning CRUD App

* Get User functionality to work

* Use Materialize-Bootstrap to see if I can dig it

* Brush off the rust of having not directly worked with the Rails back-end / Ruby for nearly a year

* See if concepts I've learned focusing on the FE can transfer to the BE in hopes that in becoming more versed with BE concepts, I can progress myself as a FE engineer instead of a simply designer
